Vulnerabilities

#1 Brute Force Auth Tokens

Current auth token uses random function which can be determinisitic/predictable. This can be strengthened by using urandom function in Python.

#2 Same Token Generation

Currently when a token is created it is not validated if this token was created before. As we pointed out in the vulnerbaility #1, there is a issue with using random function and this might lead to compromise of the auth token. Hence when a token is created it needs to be validated if this token was created before.

#3 Cleartext data

Current client-server communication is in cleartext, this should be encrypted so that spoofed packet captures won't be any use.

#4 Denial of Service

Current setup allows unlimited socket connections for a sourceIP, this can be restricted by tracking number of connections by sourceIp and validating if it is more than the allowed connection limit.
